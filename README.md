#overview:In this program , hash table is implemented based on seperate chaining  and hash key is generated based on ip tupple parameters like source ip,destination ip,source port,destination port and protocol.
#hash key and hash index:Based on the hash key and  maximum size hash index is generated.Depending upon the index the all the tupple parameters are stored in the hash table .
#API'S used are: insert_packet,delete_packet,lookup_packet,display.
while insertion of packet if the ip is already present it updates and increment the count .
while searching it searches for a ip address or a particular port which was entered by the user and if it finds it returns the search element is found .
while deletion it searches for the particular element entered by the user and deletes the specified element and update the count by decrementing and a makefile is created for the particular program depending upon the files which were used
#Steps to compile and run:
compiling the main program buy linking the files both hash.h hash.c with server.c
compilation:gcc -o server server.c hash.c
To run the makefile:make
after running make file it creates .o files and library.then execute the program
execution:./server
now execute the client based on the requirement if the client is TCP
compilation of TCP_client is :gcc -o tcp_client tcp_client.c
execution:./tcp_client
Now to execute UDP_client the compilition to be done as
compilation of UDP_client is:gcc -o udp_client udp_client.c
execution:./udp_client
